# Project-Module1

At this first project we should think of a topic and problem, collect experimental data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the results, all by yourself.

So, this project explores the viability and audience alignment of **ProCoffee**, a functional coffee enriched with protein and energy-boosting ingredients, designed for active individuals. The product concept is inspired by the success of **SuperCoffee** in Brazil, with the goal of testing its potential in the European market.
We used survey data (82 responses), exploratory data analysis (EDA), a bit of google trends ressearch and statistical hypothesis testing to investigate user habits and preferences around coffee, supplementation, and lifestyle.

## Ressearch questions
--> Link for the ressearch https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dKFt4_c9aSg5cz-USXcknuiGMv2KYfe7qbFtHWVbAVo/edit#responses

- Do people who consume supplements also consume functional coffee?
- Are active individuals more likely to use supplements?
- Is there a connection between valuing natural products and willingness to pay more?
- What is the demographic profile of potential early adopters?

## Worflow 
- Data collection via **Google Forms**  
- Data cleaning and enrichment with derived variables (Project-Module1.ipynb)
- Statistical testing using **Chi-Square** and **T-tests** (Project-Module1.ipynb)
- Visualizations with **Tableau Public** + **SLIDES** (.pdf)

## Some insights on the hypothesis:

- People who consume **performance supplements** (protein powder, creatine, pre-workout, vitamins) are significantly more likely to have tried functional coffee (**p = 0.0137**).
- A trend was observed where individuals with active lifestyles are more open to supplementation, though not statistically significant.
- Demographic and lifestyle segmentation helps define a clear target audience, although there was a lot of hypothesis on demographics that were not significant for conclusions on the consuption of the functional coffee.
